# Simulation program for queueing systems. 
After setting up your queueing model the program runs simulations to determine statistics about the
waiting times in the queueing system. The results are grahpically displayed in a Box-and-Whisker plot.
The program, which runs under Windows, can be downloaded [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5d4c5oY50QdLXNMbVFIVEZBbVU/edit?usp=sharing).
